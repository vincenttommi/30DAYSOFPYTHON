# Implement a linked list data structure in Python. 
# Include methods to insert a node, delete a node, and print the linked list



"""

Basic Linked list Operations

1 Traversal - access each element of the linked list
2 Insertion - add a new element to the linked list
3 Deletion - removes existing elements
4 search - find a node  in the linked list
5 sort - sorts the nodes of the linked list


Three things to remember in Linked list
head - points to the first node of the linked list
next - points of the last node , if it is null we have reached to end of the linked list
