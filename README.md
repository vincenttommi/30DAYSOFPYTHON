Use 'assign_department' method to change the department of an employee.
Use 'print_employee_details' method to print the details of an employee.
Use 'calculate_emp_salary' method takes two arguments: salary and hours_worked, which is the number of hours worked by the employee. If the number of hours worked is more than 50, the method computes overtime and adds it to the salary. Overtime is calculated as following formula:
overtime = hours_worked - 50
Overtime amount = (overtime * (salary / 50))


***

Advanced OOP in Python 
https://www.programiz.com/python-programming/inheritance

#### Exercise 
1.Inheritance: Create a class called Animal with a method speak() that prints "The animal makes a sound." Create two subclasses, Dog and Cat, which inherit from the Animal class. Override the speak() method in each subclass to print "The dog barks" and "The cat meows" respectively. Create instances of both subclasses and call their speak() methods.

*** 
2. #Polymorphism : Create a class called Shape with an abstract method area(). Implement two subclasses, Circle and Rectangle, which inherit from the Shape class. Override the area() method in each subclass to calculate and return the area of a circle and rectangle respectively. Create instances of both subclasses and call their area() methods.

***
3. Encapsulation: Create a class called BankAccount with private attributes account_number and balance. Implement public methods to access and modify these attributes. Use encapsulation to protect the data from direct access outside the class. Create an instance of the BankAccount class and demonstrate how to access and modify the account number and balance using the public methods.

https://auth0.com/blog/sqlalchemy-orm-tutorial-for-python-developers/
https://youtu.be/AKQ3XEDI9Mw
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIV8NHzboxU&amp;index=2

### Day 20: Working with SQL Relations SQLALCHEMY and Python 
Understand how to implement CRUD operations using Python and SQLAlchemy covering relationships
 1:1 relationships in sqlalchemy (CRUD)  
 1:*  relationships in sqlalchemy (CRUD) 
 *:*  relationships in sqlalchemy (CRUD) 



#### Exercise 

1. One-to-many relationship

In this exercise, we will create a one-to-many relationship between a Customer table and an Order table. The Customer table will have a id column that is the primary key, and the Order table will have a customer_id column that is a foreign key to the Customer table. Once you have the tables created, populate them with data such that using JOINs, you can query the data to see how the relationships work. For example, we can get all of the orders for a particular customer by using the join keyword. 


2. One-to-one relationship between a User table and a Profile table

In this exercise, we will create a one-to-one relationship between a User table and a Profile table. The User table will have a id column that is the primary key, and the Profile table will have a user_id column that is a foreign key to the User table.Once you have created and populated the tables with data, write a query that finds the profile for a particular user by using the join keyword, eg at id 1. 

3.   Many-to-many relationship

In this exercise, we will create a many-to-many relationship between a Book table and an Author table. The Book table will have a id column that is the primary key, and the Author table will have a id column that is the primary key. We will also create a BookAuthor table that will store the relationship between books and authors. Once you have all the 3 tables populated, write a query that gets all of the books that were written by a particular author ege  'J.R.R. Tolkien' by using the join keyword.
